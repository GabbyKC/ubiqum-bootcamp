                    <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                        in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member
                        of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood.
                        NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents
                        and former league members.</p>
