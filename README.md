# ubiqum-bootcamp

Projects I have built while attending Ubiqum Bootcamp Berlin:

### Project One:

The very first project involved building the same site "NYSL" three times.
- version one and two are design specs that were given to be implemented.
- version three was left open and I was to create my own "original" design.

This project involved utilizing HTML and CSS skills.

### Project Three:

"Stress Test". You are given two days to complete an "online bookstore". The focus here is on
fetching and displaying data. This project involved utilizing HTML, CSS, Fancybox, Javascript and Bootstrap.
(Optionally you could also add a search bar feature)
