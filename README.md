# ubiqum-bootcamp

Projects I have built while attending Ubiqum Bootcamp:

### Project One: 

The very first project involved building the same site "NYSL" three times. 
- version one and two are design specs that were given to be implemented.
- the last version was left open and I was to create my own "original" design. 

This project involed utilizing HTML and CSS skills.
