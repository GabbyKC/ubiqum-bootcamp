            <p>To support young athletes living in Chicago's northside neighborhoods, who have an
                interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to learn and practice
                skills related to the game of soccer, especially those skills related to team cooperation

            <h3>General Info</h3>
            <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                in Chicago's northside neighborhood an environment to learn and play soccer. To be a member
                of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighborhood.
                NYSL is run by a small, full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents
                and former league members.
